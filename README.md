# Data Crawling Demo

The project is a simple data crawling tool (demo).

This demo will parse the html data from a specific web page, then filter the matching html nodes on which we want to fetch the data inside.

We do not use "try...catch" in this application to catch exceptions, so it might crash under some special cases.
